/**
 * This method returns item condition metadata on one, multiple, or all eBay categories on an eBay marketplace. This metadata consists of the different item conditions (with IDs) that an eBay category supports, and a boolean to indicate if an eBay category requires an item condition. <br><br>If applicable, this metadata also shows the different condition descriptors (with IDs) that an eBay category supports.<br><br><span class="tablenote"><b>Note:</b> Currently, condition grading is only applicable to the following trading card leaf categories: <ul><li>Non-Sport Trading Card Singles</li><li>CCG Individual Cards</li><li>Sports Trading Cards Singles</li></ul>and the following coin categories:<ul><li>Coins: US</li><li>Coins: World</li><li>Coins: Canada</li><li>Coins: Ancient</li><li>Coins: Medieval</li></ul>Note that these coin categories are not leaf categories, so condition grading is available for all leaf categories descending from the above categories (except for rolls, sets, and lots).<br><br>Additionally, condition grading is available for Salvage items in select categories for eligible users. Use the <b>getItemConditionPolicies</b> method to see supported categories.</span><br>The identifier of the eBay marketplace is passed in as a path parameter, and unless one or more eBay category IDs are passed in through the <b>filter</b> query parameter, this method will return metadata on every single category for the specified marketplace. If you only want to view item condition metadata for one eBay category or a select group of eBay categories, you can pass in up to 50 eBay category ID through the <b>filter</b> query parameter.<br><br><span class="tablenote"><span style="color:#FF0000"><strong>Important:</strong></span> <b>Certified - Refurbished</b>-eligible sellers, and sellers who are eligible to list with the new values (EXCELLENT_REFURBISHED, VERY_GOOD_REFURBISHED, and GOOD_REFURBISHED) must use an OAuth token created with the <a href="/api-docs/static/oauth-authorization-code-grant.html" target="_blank">authorization code grant flow</a> and <b>https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope/sell.inventory</b> scope in order to retrieve the refurbished conditions for the relevant categories.<br/><br/>Refurbished item conditions are only supported in the Australia, Canada, French Canada, Germany, France, Italy, UK, and US marketplaces.
